                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">One of the reasons I have an enduring love for music is its unparalleled ability to whisk me away from reality, ushering me into a realm of enchantment. Lana Del Rey possesses this extraordinary gift. She was my steadfast companion, steering me through the humdrum days of middle and high school.
                    Even now, if someone asks about my favorite artists, Lana Del Rey is definitely on the list. I first stumbled upon her music in middle school. It was just another regular afternoon after school, sitting at my plain desk from Ikea.
                    Before diving into my schoolwork, I would always hop on YouTube and explore music videos of artists I'd never heard of before. Music was like a scented candle, setting a specific mood, whether it took me somewhere familiar or entirely new.
                    When the intro to "Summertime Sadness" softly began playing, I got carried away to a world I had yet to uncover.

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    As I grew older, I delved deeper into Lana Del Rey's lyrics and came across some rather "ultraviolent" themes. 
                    Take, for instance, the line "he hit me and it felt like a kiss." It's undeniably a controversial subject for pop music. But did she shy away from it? Not at all. Even though she justified it through her post-feminist perspective, it didn't alter the fact that her music seemed to romanticize abuse, particularly to her young female audience. Recognizing the potential harm, Lana decided to cease performing "Ultraviolence" in her concerts.

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    I align with the public consensus on this matter, yet I believe there's something to learn from Lana's view. 
                    Before encountering her, the term "post-feminism" was not familiar to me. 
                    However, when I got to learn about it, it  broaden my viewpoints. While society may label an action as wrong, an individual might still hold an affinity for it. As long as this preference doesn't cause harm to others, why should we be so fixated on what's socially sanctioned?
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    Lana prompts me to scrutinize my perspective on society. She throws down the gauntlet to the world, urging us to break free from the confines of current norms. She's unafraid to challenge the status quo. That's why I admire her.
